### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 

- Identify API and problems to solve 
- Set up API and get data rending in the console  
- Set up the following states: landing page, search result state, no results
- Display data with trail name and length 
- Search by trail length
- Mobile compatibility

#### PostMVP  

- Display data with trail description and surface-type
- Search by surface typy
- High risk: Add second API to provide trail address (bike API does not supply address)
- High risk: Use local storage to save paths users want to try
