## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Identify API and problems to solve 
- Set up API and get data rending in the console  
- Set up the following states: landing page, search result state, no results
- Display data with trail name and length 
- Search by trail length
- Mobile compatibility

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Display data with trail description and surface-type
- Search by surface typy
- Add second API to provide trail address (bike API does not supply address)
- Use local storage to save paths users want to try

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable |High Level | Status
|---|---| ---|
|August 14-16| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|Monday, August 17| Project approval, then Header, Search  working in console|Incomplete
|Tuesday, August 18| Displaying results on page including no results, working on mobile| Incomplete
|Wednesday, August 19| Adding more parameters to search and results, as will as improved styling | Incomplete
|Thursday, August 20| styled loading page, get address | Incomplete
|Friday, August 21| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Search to feed to API | H | 5hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Base HTML: Header, Footer, search section, results section, no results view, landing view | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| CSS: Header, Footer, search section, results section, no results view, landing view | H | 5hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Mobile Optimization | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
