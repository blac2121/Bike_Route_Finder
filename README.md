### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 

- Identify API 
- Set up API and render data on the page  
- Set up filter to filter trail length
- Set up the following states: filter removes old data set and updates with new set, no results
- Display data with trail name and length 
- Mobile compatibility

#### PostMVP  

- Display data with trail description and surface-type
- Set up filter to filter surface typy
- Allow user to choose between MI and KMs (currently is in MI)
- Display a set amount of description characters and impement a "read more" concept
- High risk: Use local storage to save paths users want to try
- High risk: Add second API to provide trail address (bike API does not supply address or location so this might be impossible)
