### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 

- Identify API 
- Set up API and render data on the page  
- Set up filter to filter trail length
- Set up the following states: filter removes old data set and updates with new set
- Set up a clear filter that resets the filter to default, removes results that were there, and returns results to landing state (all results)
- Display data with trail name and length 
- Mobile compatibility

#### PostMVP  

- Display data with trail description and surface-type
- Set up filter to filter surface type
- Sort data set by trail_length (default was by trail name)
- No results
- landing page of all results
- Allow user to choose between MI and KMs (currently is in MI)
- Display a set amount of description characters and implement a "read more" concept
- High risk: Use local storage to save paths users want to try
- High risk: Add second API to provide trail address (bike API does not supply address or location so this might be impossible)

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of and a brief description.  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Change Log
  
 - Moved fitler section from top below the header to side on desktop view because there were not enough filter items to fit across the page and looked great as a side bar.
